This Python program provides an interactive color selector using Tkinter, allowing users to input RGB values, choose a color from a dialog, or generate a random color.
It displays the selected or generated color in a new window along with its RGB representation.
The program combines user-friendly color selection with flexibility for both predefined shades and infinite color possibilities.

        MEMORIES FROM VJTI
    </div>
    <p id="memory">
       <h2>
        I have a very distinct and vibrant memory from VJTI itself
       </h2> 
       I am in the chess team of the VJTI sports<br>
       so I got the chance to work with fourth years in setting up this years chess event "ENTHUSIA"<br>
       we had to start wrok from 3 the day before since we were unable to get space for conducting the <br>
       event, so I helped them write a letter to the dean to request for granting space in the VJTI college <br>
       so that we could the many participants that had enrolled for it<br>
       the next day I helped the seniors from 7 AM to set up the place after<br>
       one of them was able to secure the boards for the tournaments<br>
       It ws a really fun event and I enjoyed it alot. I also learened the value of team work.

Book shelf design:(Question)
Your friend, Yash is very careful about keeping his room clean. He wants to keep all the things in their respective place. Help him set up the structure of his three books on a book shelf. 

Could you design a book shelf for him and keep the books in the order he has asked you to?

Instructions:
The shelf should be 'gray' in colour, 180px high, and 150px wide, and should have a border of 5px thickness and brown colour.
Inside the shelf, three books have to be kept one over another.
All the books fit exactly inside the shelf in width and share the height of the shelf equally.
Try to match the design as provided.
Note:
Create a parent div for the shelf, and enclose three divs inside it to form the structure.
